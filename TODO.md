## Things I want to add to this

- Remove need to add '.md' to end of filename
  - Will just need to refactor the code a bit. Main thing will be to ensure that any references to the filename get appended with '.md'
- Format title of post to start as filename
  - To do this, should be able to just use the same format as the original, except instead of replacing for date, replace for title

## To Consider

- Templates
  - Put Template in Settings
- Figure out what can be moved to settings and used there
- Support Multiple layouts, with different templates

## After I get this working, need to do

- Change postSnippet back to a default, not specific to my theme
- Put my code for postSnippet into a template
